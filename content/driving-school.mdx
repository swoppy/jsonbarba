### Day 1:
I've just arrived at their training center in Mandaluyong. Everyone I saw working there appears quite professional. There were about 30 of us, and we're starting right on time.

A lot discussions, and it was divided into:
- knowing the mechanisms of your car
- defensive driving and traffic rules
- rights as a lisenced driver

Understanding your car’s mechanisms is about knowing how to operate the vehicle, from pressing buttons to steering the wheel. The instructor spent about an hour or two going over these basics. The larger part of the day, though, was focused on defensive driving and traffic rules, plus some requirements of having a car like garage and insurance and mention a bit about different implementing authorities as well. By the end, they wrapped up with a discussion on your rights as a licensed driver.


### Day 2: (oh they have bikes too! 🛵)
First thing in the morning, we had a mid-sized quiz covering all the discussions from day one. It was a 60-point quiz, if I remember correctly. After that, we moved on to scenario-based topics and a general review. Why? Because, surprise—we’re taking the final 120-point exam today with an 85% passing mark, just a little over two hours before they let us go. Meanwhile, right outside of our room, other people were busy taking their practical driving course on bikes.

Back to the exam, many students finished early, but I took my time and was almost the last to submit my paper, with only a few students remaining. I asked the instructor how soon I could expect the results, and he advised me to follow up with my driving school branch in 2 to 3 days.

### Results:
So I followed up with my branch in about a week, and (drum roll 🥁)... I passed with a mark of 107/120.
